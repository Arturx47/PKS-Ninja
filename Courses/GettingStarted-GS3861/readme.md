# PKS Ninja Community Getting Started Guide

## Community QuickStart

Complete the following quickstart steps to get started with the PKS-Ninja Community

- Step 1: Basic Linux Skills and awareness of computer operating systems and common system administration concepts typically taught in a standard introductory Linux course are needed for all students. Please see the [Foundational and Prerequisite Skills]() page for more details and links to relevant resources that can help students learn any needed foundational or prerequisite skills
- Step 2: Review the [Community Welcome Message]() and the [Community Homepage](https://github.com/cna-tech/pks-ninja) to learn more about the community
- Step 3: Review the [Getting in the loop]() section below and sign up for the community mailing list and slack channel
- Step 4: Follow all the steps in the [Creating your Student Folder](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/master/LabGuides/CreateStudentFolder-SF6361) Lab Guide. This is an important setup step as most community courses and lab guides will require you to use your student folder
- Step 5: Review the [Building your Devops Workstation](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/master/LabGuides/DevopsWorkstation-DW5008) lab guide to learn practical tips and tricks for optimizing your workstation/jumpbox environments, using IDE's and other common tools that will make your life easier and more productive when working with devops and cloud native platforms
- Step 6: Review the [Setting up your Contributor Workspace](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/master/LabGuides/ContributorWorkspace-CW4267) lab guide. A central tenant of the PKS-Ninja community is to learn by doing. Contributing to git projects and github communities is a critical skill, and all community participants are strongly encouraged to contribute back to the site as a key part of the learning experience. Contributing back to the site can be as simple as opening a git issue ticket to report a problem, or updating a simple typo, or many other simple steps that even beginner students can easily complete can help support the community while teaching valuable skills and enhancing the participants public github profile and portfolio. Also,many courses and lab guides will have exercises that require contribution so all students should follow this step and to be prepared to contribute whenever they see any typo or error or other recommended update or addition
- Step 7: Build or get access to a compatible lab environment so you can go through lab exercises. All courses in the community follow a learn by doing mantra, so it is essential that you have access to a lab environment. Please see the [Getting Acess To a Lab Environment]() page for further instructions
- Step 8: Check out the [Courses Homepage](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/master/Courses) to see a list of available courses. Follow the links to any of the courses and follow the instructions to access learning materials and lab exercises
- Step 9: While Courses such as the PKS-Ninja course include several lab guides that cover a range of skills, there are many individual lab guides that focus on a specific skill or feature that are not part of a larger course. Visit the [Community Labs](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/master/Courses/CommunityLabs-CL7056) page to find a list of independent lab guides
- Step 10: Stay in the loop! Cloud native technologies constantly evolve, and people who work with these technologies need effective ways to keep their skills up to date and to continue to build additional skills and depth. New courses and lab guides for all levels from beginner to expert are added regularly, so keep an eye out for email updates to the community mailing list and visit the site regularly to enhance and grow your knowledge and skills with devops and cloud native technologies
