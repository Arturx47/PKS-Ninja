## Overview

The application deployments in this lab make use of a private container registry. We are
using software from a VMware opensource project called Harbor as our registry. Harbor
is included as an enterprise supported product with Pivotal Container Service (PKS). In
this section, you will become familiar with the core capability of Harbor. You will create a project and see how to push and pull images from the repos. You will also enable
content trust so that images are signed by the publisher and only signed images may be
pulled from the project repo. You will also be introduced to the vulnerability scanning
capability of Harbor. Most organizations will use a private registry rather than public
Docker hub to improve security and latency for their applications. Although Harbor can
be deployed as a highly available application, we have not done that for this lab.

## Step 1: Prepare Projects and Repositories

Harbor organizes images into a set of projects and repositories within those projects.
Repositories can have one or more images associated with them. Each of the images
are tagged. Projects can have RBAC (Role Based Access Control) and replication policies
associated with them so that administrators can regulate access to images and create
image distribution pipelines across registries that might be geographically dispersed.
You should now be at a summary screen that shows all of the projects in this registry.
For our lab, we are interested in a single project called library.

## Step 2: Install OpsMan Root Cert on BOSH for PKS/K8s <-> Harbor communications

Harbor requires clients to connect via SSL. In order for a container host to push/pull images to/from Harbor, the participants must agree on a common CA or self-signed (sometimes referred to as 'custom') root certificate as a source for trust. A root certificate is a public key certificate for encryption channel negotiation that also authenticates the identity of the remote host. It is not used for authorization purposes.

For PKS deployed K8s nodes, BOSH automates the process of root certificate trust(s) configuration via its tile configured list of trusted root certificates. For non-PKS/BOSH deployed participants (e.g. Devloper worsktations, CI/CD tools, etc.), you will need to manually configure a root certificate trust.

In this section you will install the Ops Manager root certificate in the BOSH director tile. Among other connections, this will enable trust between all PKS deployed K8s nodes and the Harbor registry. This is due to BOSH and Harbor registry having been deployed by Ops Manager with its root certificate configured as trusted root certificate automatically. Essentially, this allows all PKS deployed k8s nodes to establish SSL communication with all other Ops Manager deployed services.

2.1 Log into the Ops Manager UI, go to `Admin > Settings > Advanced` and click `Download Root CA Cert` as shown in Screenshot 2.1

<br/>

2.2 From the ControlCenter desktop open Notepad++, select `File > Open` and select the `root_ca_certificate` from the `E:\Downloads` directory, and copy the contents of the file to the clipboard. This is the root cert that you downloaded in the previous step

2.4 In the Ops Manager UI on the top menu bar click `Installation Dashboard`, next select `Review Pending Changes` and on the `Review Pending Changes`, select `Apply Changes`. Monitor the `Applying Changes` screen until the deployment is complete

Note: In the nested example lab, this step took ~40 minutes to complete

This completes the Ops Manger certificate setup for PKS/K8s <-> Harbor connections

## Step 3: Install Harbor certificate on `cli-vm`

Harbor and container registries in general typically need to negotiate communication with clients other than just K8s nodes, for example, developer workstations, pipeline tools, etc. When providing certificates for external clients fpr the sole purpose of communicating with Harbor, you should use the Harbor self-signed certificate instead of the Ops Man certificate. This minimizes the distribution of the Ops Manager certificate and is just good practice. Accordingly, we will install the Harbor certificate on the cli-vm ubuntu host we will be using to manually interact with docker and Harbor in this lab

Note: `cli-vm` is just a standard ubuntu jumpbox with docker, PKS CLI, Kubectl, GIT and a few other utilities installed

3.1 From the Ops Manager homepage, click on the `VMware Harbor Registry` tile, go to the `Certificate` tab and copy the SSL certificate text from the top textbox

<br/>

3.2 From the ControlCenter Desktop, open putty and under `Saved Sessions` connect to `cli-vm`.

<details><summary>Screenshot 3.2 </summary>
<img src="Images/2018-10-23-03-04-55.png">
</details>
<br/>

3.3 Install the cert as a trusted source on the cli-vm by navigating to the `/etc/docker/certs.d/harbor.corp.local` directory (create this dierectory if i doesn't already exist) and creating a `ca.crt` file with the certificate text you copied in the previous step using the following commands:

```bash
mkdir /etc/docker/certs.d/harbor.corp.local
cd /etc/docker/certs.d/harbor.corp.local
nano ca.crt
# Paste the certificate text into nano, save and close the file
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart docker
```

</details>
<br/>

You have now prepared `cli-vm' for secure communication with Harbor

## Step 4: Build Docker Image for Planespotter Frontend

In Step 4, you will clone the planespotter repo and use the downloaded source files to build a container for the planespotter frontend app, and prepare Harbor for the planespotter app deployment you will do later in Lab 5.

In this case we will only build the planespotter frontend container ourselves, as the planespotter repo already includes K8s deployment manifests configured to download pre-built containers from docker hub. While we do not have to build the containers in this case, its valuable to see the process and how to setup K8s manifests to pull from either Harbor or Docker Hub later in Lab 5

4.1 From the ControlCenter Desktop, open putty and under `Saved Sessions` connect to `cli-vm` and wait for the bash prompt

4.2 From the cli-vm prompt, clone the planespotter github repository with the following commands:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/yfauser/planespotter.git
```

4.3 View the planespotter frontend dockerfile with the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/planespotter/frontend/
cat Dockerfile
```

<img src="Images/2018-10-24-03-17-58.png">
</details>
<br/>

4.5 Update the image tag and push to harbor with the following commands - be sure to replace the value `a6a227b1a503` in the `docker tag` command below with the tag value you gathered in the previous step  

```bash
docker tag a6a227b1a503 harbor.corp.local/library/frontend:v1
<<<<<<< HEAD
docker login harbor.corp.local
 - User Name: Admin
 - Password: VMware1!
=======
>>>>>>> 4b83042eb5d684ff5a9895bdbb90b9dd9bc39862
docker push harbor.corp.local/library/frontend:v1
```

If docker push fails with "denied: requested access to the resource is denied", do "docker login harbor.corp.local" with user id=admin, and password = VMware1!, and then do docker push as above.

<!--

## Step 5 Content Trust & Vulnerability Scanning

Content trust allows admins to require that images be signed in order for the container to run. In this section, you will push untrusted and trusted images to Harbor that we have pre-installed in the `cli-vm` in your the lab vPod, use them to validate the content trust feature You will also trigger a Clair vulnerability scan and view the results. Note that content trust and vulnerability scanning features are independent of one another and can be used seperately

5.1 Resume or if needed reopen your SSH connection to `cli-vm` and upload the untrusted image with the command `docker push harbor.corp.local/trusted/helloworld:V2`

</details>
<br/>

5.2 From `cli-vm` configure environmental variables that enable the docker client to validate signed images with Harbor and upload the trusted image with the following commands. Use the passphrase `handsonlab` when prompted

```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST_SERVER=https://harbor.corp.local:4443
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
docker push harbor.corp.local/trusted/nginx:V2
#passphrase = handsonlab

## Click here to proceed to [Lab 5: Deploy your First PKS Cluster & Planespotter app](../Lab5-DeployFirstCluster)



**Login to Harbor UI**

1. Click on Google Chrome
2. Click on Harbor.corp.local bookmark
3. Login to Harbor with Username: admin and Password: VMware1!

**View Projects and Repositories**



The library project contains five repositories and has no access control. it is available to
the public.

1. Click on library to see the repos

You now see the five different repos. The restreview repos will be used in Module 4 to
deploy our restaurant review application.


**View Restreview-ui Repo Images**

1. Click on the library/restreview-ui repo

**View Image Vulnerability Summary**

Notice that there are two images. During lab preparation two versions of the same
image were uploaded so that we could upgrade our application in Module 4.
Vulnerability scanning is part of PKS deployed Harbor registry.


1. Click on either of the images to see its vulnerability threat report.

**View Image Vulnerability Report**

Each vulnerability is detailed, along with the package containing it, and the correct
package version to fix the vulnerability.


**Create Trusted Project**

So far you have been using unsigned images. Now we want to have a production
project that only contains images that are trusted. In order to do that we must sign the
images. Let's start by creating a new project.

1. Click on Projects

**Create New Project**

1. Click on + Projects


**Enter Project Name**

1. Enter trusted for the project name and click OK

**Verify Project Created**

Note: The name of the project MUST be "trusted", in all lower case. We have tagged
images with that path for you to use later in the lab. Using a different name will cause
the image push to fail.

1. click on trusted to open your new project


**Enable Content Trust on Your Project**

1. Click on Configuration


We have options to Enable Content Trust and prevent vulnerable images from running.
The image vulnerability restricts the pulling of images with CVEs that were identified in
the image scans we saw previously. Enabling content trust means that only signed
images can be pulled from this project.

1. Enable content trust and click Save

**Push Unsigned Image**


1. Type docker push harbor.corp.local/trusted/helloworld:V2

We have an existing unsigned image that we want to push into our trusted project.

Let's go back to the Harbor UI and see our image.

**View Unsigned Image**

1. Click on Repositories
2. Click on the Repo name to see the individual image tags
3. Note that the image is unsigned

Now let's go back to the CLI

**Enable Docker Content Trust**

1. Type export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST_SERVER=https://harbor.corp.local:4443
2. Type export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1

These two commands enable image signing through Docker content trust and point to
the Notary server. Our notary server is our Harbor registry


**Push Signed Image**

1. Type docker push harbor.corp.local/trusted/nginx:V2
2. Type passphrase at all prompts: handsonlab

The root passphrase is only entered the first time you push a new image to your project.
Note that you should not use the standard hol password 'VMware1!'. Docker notary
doesn't seem to like the !. handsonlab was used as the password in testing.

Let's return to Harbor and see our signed image.

**View Signed Image**


1. Click on Respositories in Harbor so your nginx image is visible
1. Click on trusted/nginx image and verify that it was signed

Let's create Kubernetes pods from our two images and see what happens. Return to
the CLI.

**Create Pod From Unsigned Image**

1. Type kubectl apply -f /home/ubuntu/apps/hello-trusted-unsigned.yaml
2. Type kubectl get pods

Notice that there was an error pulling the image. Let's investigate further.


**Describe Pod To Find Error**

1. Enter kubectl describe po/helloworld-v2-#########

Replace the ###### with the pod id from your previous kubectl get pods command.
You can see why the pod failed to create. The image was not signed. Now let's run a
pod with our signed image.

First let's clean up.

**Clean Up Pod**

1. Type kubectl delete -f /home/ubuntu/apps/hello-trusted-unsigned.yaml

This command will delete our deployment.

**Create Pod From Signed Image**

The first thing we need to do is create a secret. This will be mounted on our pod and
shared with Harbor for authentication when pulling our image from the registry.

1. Type kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret
    --docker-server=http://harbor.corp.local --docker-username=admin
    --docker-password=VMware1! --docker-email=admin@corp.local


The secret contains the information needed to login to the registry. Let's now take a
look at the yaml file for our signed image.

**View Yaml To Create Pod From Signed Image**

1. Type cat nginx-trusted-signed.yaml

Note the imagePullSecrets refers to the secret we just created. Now we will create our
pod from the signed image.


**Create Pod**

1. Type kubectl apply -f nginx-trusted-signed.yaml
2. Type kubectl get pods

**Describe Pod To Verify Successful Image Pull**

1. Type kubectl describe po/nginx-##### where ###### is the number for your pod
    in the get pods command


**Clean Up Deployment**

1. Type kubectl delete -f nginx-trusted-signed.yaml
