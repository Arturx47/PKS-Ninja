2.2.3 From the control center destop use putty to connect to `cli-vm` and enter the following commands to clone the repo. Note that first you will create a seperate directory for the forked clone in case anyone has cloned the source repo to their environment, this will prevent confusion. There is no requirement to have any special naming of folders where forked directories are cloned. 

Note: Be sure to replace the URL in the `git clone` command with the URL of your fork of the PKS-Ninja repo

```bash
mkdir ~/Forked
cd ~/Forked
git clone https://github.com/yourAccountName/PKS-Ninja.git # replace the url with the url to your fork of the PKS-Ninja repo
cd PKS-Ninja
```
